                                               "WOMENS AND THERE INSECURITES"
                                               
In a world that constantly defines how women should look, act, speak, or even dream — many women carry the weight of insecurities shaped by society, culture, and comparison. But within that same world, they also rise with power, resilience, and unapologetic confidence.

                                                         "Quiet but Heavy" 
*Women often express their insecurities in subtle yet powerful ways:
*Through hesitation to speak up in rooms where their voices have been ignored.
*Through apologies for taking space emotional, physical, or professional.
*By hiding their scars, stretch marks, ambitions, or emotions to meet someone else’s comfort.
*Through silence — because the world has taught many that softness equals weakness.
*Unrealistic beauty standards
*Fear of judgment or rejection
*Internalized comparison with others
*Cultural or religious expectations
*Past trauma 

         Just admitting “I’m not OKAY” is a kind of strength the world often overlooks.
 
When a woman is constantly expected to give without question, she begins to ask herself:

(“Am I enough?”,“Do I matter, or am I just useful?”,“What if I stopped doing everything — would anyone notice?”)

She starts to doubt her VOICE, fearing it’s too loud or too soft.
She questions her WORTH, because no one reflects it back.
She hides her pain behind a smile, thinking she should be "strong," even when she's exhausted.

This is how insecurities are born ,but from a world that normalizes neglecting her needs and expecting her to endure.

                                " What WOMEN really needs "
                                 
*To be seen beyond what she does for others.
*To be heard without being interrupted or dismissed.
*To be valued for who she is, not just for the roles she plays.
*Because no matter how much strength a woman carries, she should never have to prove her worth to be respected.

And I conclude saying that Every woman deserves more than silent expectations and unnoticed effort. She deserves recognition, care, and space to be vulnerable without fear. Her insecurities are not flaws, they are reflections of a world that hasn’t always treated her right.
